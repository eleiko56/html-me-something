        <h2>An unplanned career </h2>
              <p>I never planned to be a writer. In fact, I'm not sure what it <em>means</em> to be a writer. 
                Without getting all existential about it, 
                I'm a person who has published multiple books with major publishers, 
                has more planned for the future, and does a lot of "utility" writing and editing as well.
                <br><br>Did you ever wonder who writes test banks and instructor's manuals for textbooks? 
                Or the entries in all those encyclopedias in the library? Probably 
                someone like me. It's not glamorous, but it pays. This kind of writing is also 
                useful practice in getting over yourself and getting on with the task at hand.
              </p>
        
        <h2>It all started with SPSS</h2>
              <p> I got a late start, and my writing evolved naturally from the work I was doing as a statistician.
                My opus 1 is not much of a beach read, but it's still in print, and still a fundamental source 
                for those who want to do more than click on the menus in SPSS (a.k.a. the "click and shit" approach). 
              </p>

        <h2>Data analysis for people who hate collecting data</h2>
              <p>The second book came about when I was recruited at a conference by a rep
                  from Cambridge University Press (!). 
                  I love working with secondary data (basically, data collected by someone else,
                  often a governmental agency like the CDC), so I wrote a book about that.
              </p>

        <h2>A real money-spinner: Statistics in a Nutshell</h2>
              <p>My next book has caused me the most grief, but has also been the most rewarding.
                  I wrote it to fill an unmet need--a statistics book for adults who need to learn some 
                  statistics for their work, or who took a course a long time ago and need a practical refresher.
                  I get a bump in sales every August and September, so I suspect a lot of college
                  students are buying it also. It was also my first experience collaborating on a book with someone
                  (via long distance--my co-author lives in Australia!).
              </p>

              <p>There's now a second edition (with me as sole author) and some translations also!
              </p>

              <h2>My start with encyclopedias</h2>
              <p>I got my start as an editor at about the same time, and am particularly proud of my very first 
                  encyclopedia. I included more biostatistical articles than a pure epidemiologist
                  probably would have, as well as articles about things like 
                  harm reduction and sexual minorities. Since the main purchasers of SAGE encyclopedias are
                  public and univerity libraries, the information in these volumes is accessible to many 
                  people who might never come across, say, an article in a professional journal.  
              </p>

              <h2>Health care: other countries do it better</h2>
              <p>Both personally and professional, I find the American "system" of health care to be bizarre, wasteful,
                  cruel. Being a person who works with data, and is always open to hearing how someone else has solved
                  a problem, I thought a book about how health care works in other countries might help people realize that
                  other countries have found better ways to deliver care, but no luck so far.

              <h2>Working with ABC-CLIO</h2>
              <p>I started writing for ABC-CLIO a few years ago. They specialize in reference books for public and 
                  college libraries, and my specialties with them are medicine and public health. This, my second 
                  book with ABC-CLIO, came out in 2018.

              <h2>Time for some fun</h2>
              <p>I don't spend <em>all</em> my writing time on professional books. I began reviwing movies almost
                10 years ago, and am currently the movies editor for <a href="http://theartsstl.com/">TheArtsStl</a>, a local
                popular culture website. Since I'm a proud member of the <a href-"http://ofcs.org/Online">Online
                Film Critics Society</a> , I also get to see just about any filmbeing put up for awards, 
                even if I don't review it. I also cover film festivals when I can, and have a healthy stash of
                press passes to prove it.  </p>

              <h2>Plans for the future</h2>
              <p> There are so many books I want to write, but choosing which projects are worth pursuing isn't a simple 
                  decision. The world needs a good guide to math for biology students and lab workers, for
                  instance, and I have a model in mind, but have several other things to finish first. On a
                  more popular note, I really enjoy the Quercus 'in minutes" series and it does not currently 
                  have a volume on statistics. I know I'll get that pitch out the door any day now...
