        <h2>An unplanned career </h2>
              <p class="top" >I never planned to be a writer. In fact, I'm still not entirely sure what it <em>means</em> to be a writer.
                When an American meets someone for the first time, usually one of the first questions out of his or her mouth is
                "What do you do?" and to say "I'm a writer" sounds both pretentious and delusional. To most people
                a writer is either someone whose novels perennially top the <em>New York Times</em>
                bestseller list, or a hobbyist who self-publishes novels about her cats. 
                <br><br>Without getting all existential about it, 
                I'm a person who has published multiple books with major publishers, mostly as an
                extension of my work in statistics, medicine, and public health. I had no idea when
                I submitted my first book proposal that writing would become such an important part
                of my life, but I'm really glad it has. 
                <br><br>Besides books and professional articles, I do a lot of "utility" writing and 
                editing as well.
                Did you ever wonder who writes test banks and instructor's manuals for textbooks? 
                Or the entries in all those encyclopedias in the library? Probably 
                someone like me. It's not glamorous, but it pays. This kind of writing is also 
                useful practice in getting over yourself and getting on with the task at hand.

            <h2>It all started with SPSS</h2>
              <p>I got a late start in the writing business, after spending quite a few years working as a statistician.
                  My first book grew naturally out of that line of work, as I noticed there was no book on the market
                  that discussed SPSS code clearly and simply, with a view to practical applications including data
                  management tasks. At the time, most beginning SPSS books assumed the user was only interested in running
                  the program through the GUI menus (better known as the "click and shit" approach) rather than learning 
                  the program's syntax. My opus 1 is not much of a beach read, but it's still in print, and is still a useful
                  resource for those who work with SPSS.

                <h2>Data analysis for people who hate to collect data</h2>
                    <p>The second book also drew directly on the work I was doing as a statistician. To put it simply, I 
                        like analyzing data a whole lot more than I like collecting it. My interests also run to questions too
                        large to be answered by the type of data a single research group can collect. The solution: work with secondary data, meaning data collected by someone else
                        (often a governmental agency like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
                        I was recruited to write this book by a representative of Cambridge University
                        Press, which gives me a good name to drop when I want to impress someone.

            <h2>A real money-spinner: My first book with O'Reilly</h2>
                <p>My next book caused me the most grief, but has also been the most rewarding.
                    I wrote it to fill yet another unmet need--a statistics book for adults who need to learn some 
                    statistics for their work, or who took a course a long time ago and need a practical refresher.
                    I get a bump in sales every August and September, so I suspect a lot of college
                    students are buying it also. It was my first experience collaborating on a book with someone
                    (via long distance--my co-author lives in Australia!), and was also a good lesson in the benefits 
                    of writing for a respected series (people don't necessarily know me, but they know the O'Reilly
                    Nutshell series).

                <h2>The gift that keeps on giving</h2>
                    <p>There's now a second edition (with me as sole author) and some translations also!
                        Authors often say that their dream is to be on the "permanent backlist", which 
                        means that your book remains in the publisher's active catalogue for years, and the 
                        royalties continue to roll in for years after you completed the book. Harper Lee is the model
                        for this kind of success--you only need write one book in your life if it's as good, and 
                        as perennially popular, as <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em>. I'm nowhere near her class, of
                        course, but <em>Statistics in a Nutshell</em> is the kind of steady earner that makes it 
                        easier to ride out the feast-or-famine cycle typical of a freelance writer's income.

                <h2>Breaking into the Editing Market</h2>
                    <p> I got my start as an editor at about the same time I was writing <em>Statistics in a 
                        Nutshell</em>, and I'm particularly proud of the first encyclopedia I edited, the <em>
                        Encyclopedia of Epidemiology</em>, published by SAGE. Editing an encyclopedia is a more 
                        influential job than you might think. The Editor-in-Chief 
                        gets to decide what articles will be included in the encyclopedia, for instance, and I included more biostatistical articles than a pure 
                        epidemiologist probably would have, as well as articles about public health issues like 
                        harm reduction and threats faced by sexual minorities.

                <h2>Health Care: Other Choices are Available</h2>
                    <p> Both personally and professional, I find the American "system" of health care to be bizarre, wasteful,
                        cruel. Being a person who works with data, and is always open to hearing how someone else has solved
                        a problem, I thought a book about how health care works in other countries might help people realize that
                        other countries have found better ways to deliver care. Unfortunately, there's too many financial interests,
                        and too much belief in American exceptionalism, to make information a particularly useful weapon in
                        this battle.

                    <h2>Working with ABC-CLIO</h2>
                    <p>I started writing for ABC-CLIO, a company specializing  in reference books for public and 
                        undergraduate libraries, a few years ago. Writing for that audience demands clarity and particular attention to presenting
                        controversial issues in a balanced manner. My specialties at ABC-CLIO are medicine and public health, and writing
                        for them has allowed me to explore topics of interest to me personally that are also of national significance. My
                        <em>Transgender Health Issues</em>>, my second book with ABC-CLIO, came out in 2018; I wrote a book about
                        drug resistance for them, and am currently working on a volume about genetic testing.

                    <h2>A Reference Volume for Gale</h2>
                    <p>One of the advantages of knowing statistics and being comfortable with secondary data 
                        is that you can write knowledgeably about subjects outside your specific professional focus. Case 
                        in point: a series volume I wrote for Gale about
                        careers and occupations. My job on this volume was similar to that of an editor, since 
                        my main task was to update statistics in the previous volume (which were largely based on government
                        reports issued every year or two. I also added some new sections (even worked in my favorite
                        economist, Paul Krugman), and Gale gave me an author credit.

                    <h2>Plans for the future</h2>
                    <p>There are so many books I want to write, but choosing which projects
                        to pursue next isn't always a simple decision. The world needs a good guide to math for biology 
                        students and lab workers, for instance, and I have a model in mind, but have several other things 
                        to finish first. On a more popular note, I really enjoy the Quercus 'in minutes" series and it does 
                        not currently have a volume on statistics. I know I'll get that pitch out the door any day now...
